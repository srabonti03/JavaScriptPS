//Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Take the length and width as variables, and use arithmetic operators to find the area (length * width) and perimeter (2 * (length + width)).

let len = 100;
let wid = 50;
let area = len * wid;
let perimeter = 2 * (len + wid);
console.log(`Area of this rectangle is : ${area}, & the Perimeter is: ${perimeter}`);
